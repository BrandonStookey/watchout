# Watchout

This is a project I completed as a student at Hack Reactor Remote Beta. This project was worked on with a pair. Watchout is based off of the game collider. My pair and I recreated it using D3.js.

# Watchout
Watchout is a simple game

- we have a player, and some enemies, who move randomly
- if the player gets hit, our score is reset
- otherwise our score goes up over time
